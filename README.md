# Purpose
When traveling it is often hard to keep up with what materials can be recycled in each city you go to. Every location has different
regulations on what can be recycled and that information can sometimes be difficult to find. To make it easier, we want to create a
website that will give you information on recycling in each city/state in the US. Users will be able to type in where they are and then
get specific information on recycling for that location. 

# Features and Capabilities
